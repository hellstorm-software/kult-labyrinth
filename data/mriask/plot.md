# My Roomate is a serial killer

My roommate is a serial killer. Now normally, that would be a sort of deal breaker, you know, the risk of dying and all. And I know this is gonna sound crazy, but hear me out…

I don’t think she knows I know yet, I mean how could she? Unless she somehow guesses I can smell human blood up to a few miles away, there’s no reason she’d assume I know anything. She’s good I’ll give her that. I don’t think anyone else even suspects her. Like I said the only reason I know is cuz I can smell it on her when she comes home.

I haven’t eaten human in years. 
It’s too messy. 
But she’s good…
