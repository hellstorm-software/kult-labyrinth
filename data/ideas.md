Edenfall, a desolate city amidst a barren wasteland. A synthetic sky towers above, shining a flickering blue sky. At the city's center is an enormous hole, spanning about 500m across, and thousands of meters down. 

That hole is the entrance to the Labyrinth, an enormous, self assembling maze that exists under the planets surface.
